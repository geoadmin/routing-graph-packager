# Contribution Guidelines

## Submitting PRs

We :heart: patches, fixes & feature PRs and want to make sure everything goes smoothly for you before and while while submitting a PR.

For development we use:

- [`poetry`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/) as package manager
- `pytest` for testing
- [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) to make sure the formatting is consistent.
- [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting
- [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) hook for formatting and linting

When contributing, ideally you:

- close an existing issue. If there is none yet for your fix, please [create one](https://github.com/gis-ops/routing-graph-packager/issues/new).
- write/adapt unit tests
- use docstrings for public classes/methods & responsible use of comments
- use meaningful commit messages
- branch off `master` and PR against `master` as well

## Setup

1. Create and activate a new virtual environment

2. Install development dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

3. Please add a pre-commit hook, so your code gets auto-formatted and linted before committing it:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Tests

You'll need a few things to run the tests:

- PostreSQL installation with a DB named `gis_test` (or define another db name using `POSTGRES_DB_TEST`) **and PostGIS enabled**
- Redis database

Both can be quickly spun up by using the provided `docker-compose.test.yml`:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
```

You'll also need some fake SMTP service to handle email tests, our recommendation: [fake-smtp-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fake-smtp-server),
a NodeJS app with a frontend on `http://localhost:1080` and SMTP port 1025

We use `pytest` in this project with `coverage`:

```bash
export API_CONFIG=test
pytest --cov=routing_packager_app
```

A `coverage` bot will report the coverage in every PR and we might ask you to increase coverage on new code.
